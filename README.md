# GEN_AI_PDF_CHATBOT

**GenAI PDF Chatbot**

This project is a Generative AI-powered PDF chatbot built using LangChain, Python, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), LLM (Large Language Models), OpenAI, and PyPDF. The chatbot allows users to interact with PDF documents by asking questions, retrieving insights, and summarizing content dynamically.

**Key Features**

PDF Ingestion and Parsing: Uses PyPDF to parse and extract text from PDF documents.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Enhances the chatbot's ability to provide accurate responses by fetching relevant information from PDFs.

Large Language Model (LLM) Integration: Leverages OpenAI's GPT models to generate human-like responses.

LangChain Framework: Ensures modularity, scalability, and seamless integration of various components.

Dynamic Q&A: Users can upload PDF files and ask context-aware questions about the document's content.

**Tech Stack**

Python: Core programming language.

LangChain: Framework for building LLM-powered applications.

OpenAI: GPT models for generating responses.

PyPDF: PDF parsing and text extraction.

FAISS: For efficient similarity search and document retrieval.
